### Tweets mentioned about Bank of Amercia:
We used **Bank of America**, **#BankofAmerica**, **BofA**, **BAC** as search term to collect the tweets people posted talking about Bank of America.  
We have collected **11676** tweets in total, from **1/1/2020** to **1/31/2020** from Users talking about Bank of America.  
With these tweets we have collected, we plotted the wordCloud, conducted sentiment analysis and topic modelling to discover how do people think about their service and what do people mostly talk about when they mention Bank of America. We have analyzed the language they use and plotted the sentiment over the time period.  
To analyze the data, we used 2 different and 1 combined approach:  
Dictionary lookup: The Sentiment is scored on a scale from -5 to 5 (later rescaled to -1,1) based on the word in the dictionary (afinn).  
Machine Learning: We labelled 1500 tweets from the dataset in regards to their Sentiment. Positive = 1, Neutral = 0, Negative = -1. We trained a Random Forest Model to predict the probability of each tweet belonging to one of the specified Sentiment levels. The score is computed by multiplying the probabilities with their level and adding the numbers. E.g. Predicted (1=0.2, 0=0.1, -1=0.7) becomes 1 * 0.2 + 0 * 0.1 + -1 * 0.7 = -0.5 as a Sentiment Score.
Combined Approach: After assigning the dictionary and Machine Learning Sentiment to the tweets, the combined column is computed as the average of the 2 approaches.
